## 4. Cash Flow Analysis Frameworks

### 4.1 Cash Conversion Cycle Analysis

The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) measures the time required to convert investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales.

**Formula**: CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO
- DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding) = (Average Inventory ÷ COGS) × 365
- DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) = (Accounts Receivable ÷ Revenue) × 365
- DPO (Days Payable Outstanding) = (Accounts Payable ÷ COGS) × 365

**Warning Thresholds**:
- Increasing CCC over 3+ months
- CCC more than 25% higher than industry average
- Significant increase in any component (DIO, DSO, DPO)

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Reduce DIO**: Implement just-in-time inventory, improve forecasting
2. **Reduce DSO**: Offer early payment discounts, improve invoicing processes
3. **Increase DPO**: Negotiate better payment terms with suppliers (ethical extension, not late payment)

### 4.2 Growth-Adjusted Cash Flow Analysis

This framework compares cash flow to growth rate to identify sustainable growth thresholds.

**Analysis Method**:
1. Calculate cash flow from operations (CFO)
2. Calculate growth rate (current quarter revenue ÷ same quarter previous year revenue) - 1
3. Calculate CFO-to-Growth ratio = CFO ÷ Growth Rate

**Warning Thresholds**:
- Negative CFO with positive growth rate
- CFO-to-Growth ratio below industry average
- Declining CFO-to-Growth ratio over multiple quarters

**Response Strategies**:
1. **Low Ratio**: Consider slowing growth to allow cash flow to catch up
2. **Negative CFO**: Implement immediate cash conservation measures
3. **Declining Ratio**: Examine cost structures and pricing strategies

### 4.3 Burn Rate and Runway Analysis

Particularly useful for high-growth businesses that may operate at a loss during scaling.

**Calculation**:
- Monthly Burn Rate = (Starting Cash - Ending Cash) ÷ Number of Months
- Cash Runway = Current Cash Balance ÷ Monthly Burn Rate

**Warning Thresholds**:
- Runway less than 6 months without clear funding plans
- Increasing burn rate without corresponding growth metrics
- Burn rate exceeding pre-established budget by >10%

**Management Strategies**:
1. **Extend Runway**: Reduce non-essential expenses, focus on high-ROI activities
2. **Manage Burn Visibility**: Implement weekly cash forecasting during high-burn periods
3. **Plan Funding Cycles**: Begin fundraising when runway is at least 6-9 months
