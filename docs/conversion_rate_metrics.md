Here's a breakdown of the extracted information, including technical data, pricing, features, statistical information, etc., as requested, focusing on the relevant sections:

**I. How to Calculate Conversion Rate**

*   **Definition:** A conversion rate (CR) is the percentage of users who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase or filling out a form.
*   **Formula:** Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions / Total Number of Visitors) × 100%
*   **Example:**
    *   An online store receiving 5,000 visitors and recording 125 sales has a 2.5% conversion rate.
    *   A landing page with 2,000 visitors and 100 form submissions has a 5% conversion rate.

**II. Essential Conversion Rate Metrics**

The article breaks down conversion rate metrics into several categories. Each metric provides formulas and descriptions:

**A. Primary Conversion Metrics:**

1.  **Conversion Rate (CR)**
    *   **Description:** The percentage of users who complete a desired action (signing up, making a purchase, downloading an app) compared to the total visitors.
    *   **Importance:** High conversion rate indicates alignment of offer, messaging, and user experience. Low conversion rate requires further analysis.
2.  **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
    *   **Description:** Tracks how many users click on a link, ad, or CTA out of everyone who saw it.
    *   **Formula:** CTR = (Total Clicks / Total Impressions) × 100
    *   **Importance:** Strong CTR indicates that content or ad is catching attention. Weak CTR often indicates a need to rethink creative or targeting.
3.  **CTA Conversion Rate**
    *   **Description:** Measures how many people who clicked a CTA also completed the next step (e.g., submitting a form, starting a checkout).
    *   **Importance:** Evaluates whether CTAs are persuasive enough to drive results.
4.  **Form Conversion Rate**
    *   **Description:** Measures how many people complete a form (e.g., sign-up, lead gen) compared to those who viewed it.
    *   **Formula:** Form Conversion Rate = (Form Completions / Form Views) × 100
    *   **Importance:** Helps identify friction in the form completion process.
5.  **Sales Conversion Rate**

**B. Cost-Related Metrics:**

1.  **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**

    *   **Importance:** Indicates how efficient your marketing spend is.
2.  **Cost Per Lead (CPL)**
    *   **Description:** The cost to generate a lead (someone who shows intent to buy, e.g., fills out a form).

    *   **Importance:** Important in B2B or high-ticket B2C, where every lead counts.
3.  **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
    *   **Description:** Includes all costs associated with turning a prospect into a paying customer (ad spend, sales salaries, etc.).
    *   **Formula:** CAC = (Total Sales + Marketing Costs) / New Customers Acquired

4.  **Return on Investment (ROI)**

5.  **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**
    *   **Description:** Measures revenue earned for every dollar spent on paid ads.
