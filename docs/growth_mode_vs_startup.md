**Extracted Information:**

The article "How Growth Mode Differs from the Startup Phase of a Business" provides the following insights:

*   **Definition of Startup vs. Growth:**
    *   **Startup:** Focused on establishing workflows, bringing products/services to market, and defining brand differentiators. The expectation is that growth will follow once resources are in place.
    *   **Scaling/Growth:** An increase in revenue without a proportional increase in resources. Involves expanding staffing, locations, products, or services.

*   **Challenges of Business Growth:**
    *   Scaling requires a balance between growth, the resources needed to sustain it, and the bottom line.
    *   Cash flow becomes a critical concern. While cash flow might be relatively stable, it may not be sufficient to support growth.
    *   Higher production usually requires more resources.
    *   Growth might initially lead to financial losses.
    *   The goal of a scalable business is to increase revenue without significantly increasing costs.

*   **Funding and Revenue as a Pain Point:**
    *   A key challenge when transitioning from startup to growth is related to funding and revenue.
    *   The scope or volume of cash required changes from startup to growth.

*   **Small Business Funding Differences:**
    *   **Startup:** May struggle to secure funding.
    *   **Growth:** Established companies with a track record may find it easier to get funding from traditional sources.

*   **Benetrends' Services:** Benetrends promotes its 401(k) rollover funding (Rainmaker Plan) as a funding solution for both startup and growth phases, allowing entrepreneurs to use their retirement funds without incurring upfront taxes or penalties.

**Key Data Points:**

*   **Core Difference:** The primary distinction is the focus. Startups concentrate on establishing the business and its core offerings, while growth emphasizes expanding revenue and operations.
*   **Financial Challenges:**
    *   Managing cash flow is crucial in both phases, but the scale and complexity of cash flow management increase during growth.
    *   Funding needs evolve. Startups may struggle to obtain funding, whereas growth-stage businesses have a greater chance of securing traditional financing.
