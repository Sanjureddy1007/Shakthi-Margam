This document outlines the unique challenges women entrepreneurs face when attempting to monetize their social media presence, along with proven solutions and strategies to overcome these obstacles.

## 1. Access and Resource Challenges

### Limited Funding Access
**Challenge:**
Women entrepreneurs receive significantly less venture capital and investment funding compared to their male counterparts. Studies show women entrepreneurs receive only 2.3% of VC funding, limiting resources for paid social campaigns, content creation, and marketing staff.
